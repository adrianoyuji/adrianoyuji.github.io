          Hey! My name is Adriano Yuji Sato de Vasconcelos and I am a Front-end
          Software developer! I am currently finishing my graduation as a
          Computer Engineer in Brazil. I started focusing software development
          skills in late 2019 when I realized I could work with both design and
          programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I seek to become a professional software developer and I am always
          open to new challenges. Right now I am honing my front-end abilities
          so later I can start focusing on back-end technologies and become a
          Full-Stack developer.
